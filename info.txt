Music Metadata Organization project

Requirements:
	1) Scan all Music Folders
	2) Attach All Metadata info to the ID3v2 tags (Use Name and Artist as keys. )
	3) Retrieve Album Art (where possible)
    4) Rename files to "[Artist Name] - [Song Name].[Extension]"
    5) Identify files without Metadata

Actions:
    - QuickCheck: scans a given dir and returns info on the files present without changing anything
    - FixMetadata: Fixes the tag of the files given
    - GetCoverArt: Attempts to retrieve cover art data for all files
    - RenameAndOrganize: Renames all files to the standard format ("[Artist Name] - [Song Name].[Extension]")
    - IdentifyUnknown: Checks which songs have wrong Metadata and for which it is impossible to determine automatically (i.e. needs human interaction)
